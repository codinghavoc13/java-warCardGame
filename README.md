# War Card Game - Work in Progress

This is mostly just a personal side project that I wanted to try. As with a lot of programs I write, I see something in real life and I ask myself "How hard would it be to write a program that would do the same?" Unlike a lot of games, this doesn't really require any human interaction beyond pressing a button to deal a card, so for now it won't have any user interaction, just watching the program play War between 2 or more 'players'.

## What is War?

For those who haven't heard of it, War is a simple card game where all of the cards in a deck are dealt out to all players face down so no one knows what card is coming next. Everyone plays a card from the top of their stack by laying it down, face up. The highest card, 2 is the lowest, Ace the highest, takes all cards and adds to the bottom of their stack.

The name War comes in when two or more players have the same card, they go to war with each other. You lay three cards down, face down, then one face up. You keep going until one player has the high card (yes, I've played a few games where this was repeated).

If you run out of cards, you are out. You play until only one player remains.
